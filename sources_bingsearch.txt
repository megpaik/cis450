Data sources:

//images of books (BX-Books.csv)
http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/ 

// user scraped wikipedia movie data on github (movies.json)
https://github.com/prust/wikipedia-movie-data


Cleaning Process:

1) Converted movies.json to csv format.
2) Used "notes" column to filter on "book", "novel","story" to see which films had been adapted from books and kept only the rows meeting this condition.
3) Mapped genre column to keep only the first film genre if there is a list of genres. Ex: "Action,Drama" was mapped to "Action"
4)  "0" indicates film genres that were grouped into the "Other" category.

5) Removed 'Image-URL-S' and 'Image-URL-L' columns using R from BX-Books.csv

6)Used R to match where Movie title from movies.json is the same as Book title from BX-Books.csv and kept only this subset to use later for HTML page.
